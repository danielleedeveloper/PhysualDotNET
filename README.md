# Physual .NET

Physual C# is an MVP sandbox I created using C# in Visual Studio 2017, VelcroPhysics, and SFML.NET.  I created it to to help me decide between C# and C++ for starting to code games.  So far it appears to be quite a capable little stack for 2D game development.  Next, I'll port it to C++, Box2D, and SFML.  That should give me everything I need to do a complete comparison of the languages, libraries, workflows, and performance.
