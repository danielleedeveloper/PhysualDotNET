# Physual .NET

Physual .NET is an MVP sandbox I wrote in C# using Visual Studio 2017, VelcroPhysics, and SFML.NET.  I created it to to help me decide between C# and C++ for coding up my first games.  Next, I'll port Physual to C++, Box2D, and SFML.  That should give me everything I need to do a complete comparison of the languages and libraries.
